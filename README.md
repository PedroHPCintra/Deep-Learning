# Deep-Learning :robot:

Latest update: 04/05/2023

Welcome! This repo is a storage for all of my codes related to deep learning projects and some classes that I took. They are not currently fully organized so some of them are in Portuguese and others in English, I intend to translate all of the to english and organize the code itself using comments.

## Repo Structure :file_folder:

This repository is organized in the following way:

1. :file_folder: The first folders are specifications of the ```python``` library used to code the neural network, either [Keras](https://keras.io/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

2. :file_folder: Inside the main folders are each project. Each project has it's own folder too, containing the code (usually as a ```Jupyter Notebook``` in ```Python```). For some of them I did not upload the dataset since they are too big and some of these notebooks are private projects which use my personal data.

Overall the repository follows this structure:

:open_file_folder:```Python library``` $\rightarrow$ :open_file_folder:```Project folder``` $\rightarrow$ :computer: Codes

## Usage

If you want to use any of the codes here make sure to pay attention to the **import section** of the code and check if you have all dependencies installed. Make sure to download the whole project folder as well, not only the code, it might have some additional files needed to run the code. If you have git:octocat: installed in your computer you can also clone the whole repository by typping

```git clone https://github.com/PedroHPCintra/Deep-Learning.git```
